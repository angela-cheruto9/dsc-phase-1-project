Action has the most votes in the top movie selection.

## Conclusion

* The rating of the movies does not necessarily influence the number of movie that are produced for each genre.For example from the top_100 comedy has a low rating yet the production is high.

* Some high ratings also had a few number of votes for example the highest rating of 9.2 had 8 votes, this can be because the number of people that watch those genres of movies are not many in number.

* The rating when the genres are combined is different from when the rating is done on each genre individually
